# ANTISEQUENCE
Rust stream processing library for sequencing reads.

*Work in progress!*

## Goals
* Robust, flexible, and actually universal primitives for manipulating raw DNA/RNA sequences from fastq files
* Easily define graphs of read processing operations
* Blazing fast and scalable implementation using SIMD parallelism and multithreading
* Extensible with custom Rust code and embeddable into existing pipelines

ANTISEQUENCE should enable you to build robust, efficient, and production-ready pipelines for your sequencing data.
