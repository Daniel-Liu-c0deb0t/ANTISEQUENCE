# ANTISEQUENCE
Rust library for processing sequencing reads.

*Work in progress! Very early stages of the project.*

## Goals
* Robust, flexible, and actually universal primitives for manipulating raw DNA/RNA sequences from fastq files
* Blazing fast and scalable implementation using SIMD and CPU parallelization
* Simple interface allowing anyone (even non-Rustaceans) to pick up and use
* Extensible with custom Rust code and embeddable into existing pipelines

ANTISEQUENCE should enable you to build robust, efficient, and production-ready pipeline for your custom sequencing data.
